# AI_project2-genetic-algorithm
It's second project of Artificial intelligence course in Amirkabir University Of Technology.
Genetic algorithm in AI has been implemented in this repository with showing different states in a simple game.
The game is basically likes "Supermario". Genetic algorithm has 4 steps: initial population, fitness function, crossover, mutation. each of these steps has implemented.
